# The Unsolved Case

## The Discovery
Late one night, something unusual was found in a place everyone thought they knew well.
Sarah was wandering through the halls of Howley when she heard a loud noise. She looked in each classroom and in the last one, there was a mysterious chest with a dragon on the front.
She creeped closer to the chest when someone tapped her left shoulder. "What are you doing there?" said the elderly woman.

## The Witnesses
Several people noticed strange events, but none reported them immediately.

## Clues
Objects, notes, and minor inconsistencies began to appear. Some were real, some misleading.

## The Suspects
A few individuals seem connected to the events, though their roles are unclear.

## The Twist
Just when things seemed straightforward, new evidence complicated the case.

## Investigation
Decisions must be made about which clues to follow and which to ignore.

## The Outcome
The mystery is far from resolved. What will happen next?
